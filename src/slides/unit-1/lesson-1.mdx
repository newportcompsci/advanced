# Setting up Eclipse and Java 

---

## Warm-up

> Write a method that adds up all the numbers between 1 and 10,000

---

```java 
public static void findTotal() {
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }

    System.out.println(sum);
}

```

---

## What if we wanted to keep track of the running total?

---

### Put them in an array!

```java
public static int[] values;

public static void findTotal() {
    values = new int[10000];

    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i <= 10000; i++) {
        sum += i;
        values[i] = sum;
    }

    System.out.println(sum);
}

```

## How can we extract out this functionality?
