## Reading Files 

To read a file we need two classes: File and Scanner. 

[File Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html)

[Scanner Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html)

[BufferedReader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html)

[FileWriter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileWriter.html)

[BufferedWriter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedWriter.html)

## File 

`File` lives in the `java.io` package so we must have an import to use it.

`public File(String pathName)`

> Creates an instance of a file located at `pathName`

`File` also has some fun methods associated with it: 

| `method` | `description` |
|----------|---------------|
| `boolean isDirectory()` | returns true if it has files in it |
| `boolean isFile()` | returns true if it is a file |
| `boolean mkdir()` | creates a directory |
| `boolean createNewFile()` | creates a file |
| `boolean rename()` | renames the file |

---

## IOExceptions

Anytime a file manipulates or changes values on disk, there is a chance
that things could go wrong. To tell Java that this might occur, we must 
tell Java that the method `throws IOException` 

> You can also use `try/catch`

---

## Scanner

`Scanner` is typically used for user input, but we can also read files with it. 
We can find `Scanner` in the `java.util` package. 

`public Scanner(File source)`

`public Scanner(InputStream source)`

> If we pass our file object to scanner we can treat a file the same way as user input!

A quick refresher on `Scanner` API

| method | description |
|--------|-------------|
| `boolean hasNext()` | true if there is more to read |
| `String next()` | gets next word |
| `String nextLine()` | gets next line, up to '\n' | 
| `int nextInt()` | gets next integer |

## Where do I put the file? 

Files are referenced from the root of your project

> next to the `src` folder

---

## Your Task 

- Look up the `List` and `ArrayList` API
- Create a `.txt` with a list of words 
- Write a program that reads in those words and prints them out in reverse.
