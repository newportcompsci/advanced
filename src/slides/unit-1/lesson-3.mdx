# Basic Complexity Analysis

---

## Activity!

As a class I want you all to find the largest sub set of people that **did not** know 
each other before this class

---

## Discussion

- What made that activity hard? 
- What would the algorithm for this problem look like? 

> We'll come back to this in a little bit

---

## What does it mean to be efficient? 

> Discuss with the people sitting around you 
> what efficiency means in your everyday life

---

## How do we measure "Efficiency" in CS?

- Number of seconds it takes to run? 
- CPU Speed? 

---

## It's all about scale!

In general as long as an algorithm works on your given data set, then you use it!

It's only when you need to think about your data "growing" that we need to think about
making things more efficient.

---

## In General...Don't optimize unless you have to!

## Example 1

```java
public static void mystery(int n) {
    System.out.println("Mystery! " + n);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    mystery(10);
}
```

---

## Example 1

```java
public static void mystery(int n) {
    System.out.println("Mystery!" + n); // This only runs once
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    mystery(1000000);
}
```

> We say that this is a "constatnt time" algorithm, it runs one line of code no matter what the input is. 

---

## Example 2

```java
public static void mystery(int[] numbers) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(numbers[i]);
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = new int[10];

    mystery(values)
}
```

> How many lines of code are run here? 

---

## Example 2

```java
public static void mystery(int[] numbers) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(numbers[i]); // 10 times
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = new int[10]; // 1 time

    mystery(values)
}
```

> This runs 10 + 1 times or 11 total

---

## Example 2

```java
public static void mystery(int[] numbers) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(numbers[i]); // 1,000,000 times
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = new int[1000000]; // 1 time

    mystery(values)
}
```

> This runs 10 + 1 times or 11 total

> If the array was 1,000,000 elements then it would run 1,000,001 lines of code, in terms of any length array of size N
> we say this runs N + 1 times 

---

## Example 3

```java

public static void mystery(int[][] values) {
    for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < values[i].length; j++) {
            System.out.print(values + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] values = new int[10][10];

    mystery(values);
}

```

> How many lines of code are executed here?

---

## Example 3

```java

public static void mystery(int[][] values) {
    for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < values[i].length; j++) {
            System.out.print(values + " "); // 100 times
        }
        System.out.println(); // 10 times
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] values = new int[10][10]; // 1 time

    mystery(values);
}

```

> In total we "kind-of" execute 100 + 10 + 1 lines of code or 111 lines of code

> For a square matrix of size N x N we expect about N^2 + N + 1 lines of code to execute

---

## Asymptotic Analysis

In practice it becomes not very practical to write out the complicated expressions that describe 
an algorithm to each detail but we more or less estimate.

| Example   | N = 1 | N = 10 | N = 100 | N = 1,000,000 |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
|          1|      1|       1|        1|              1| 
|      N + 1|      2|      11|     101 |      1,000,001| 
|N^2 + N + 1|      3|     111|  10,101 |       A really big number...        | 

> As N gets really big it becomes kind of pointless to include the lower order terms. 
> So in practice we generally just take the largest contributor.

---

## Big-O Notation (Upper Bound)

Even though we dropped the lower order terms we still call this a "Worst Case."

Taking the examples from the previous slide this turns into:

| Example   | N = 1 | N = 10 | N = 100 | N = 1,000,000 |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
|       O(1)|      1|       1|        1|              1| 
|       O(N)|      1|      10|      100|            1e9| 
|     O(N^2)|      1|     100|      1e4|           1e18|

> **Fun Fact**: There exists other types of analysis such as Big-Theta and Big-Omega which 
> describe algorithms in terms of a "tight-bound" and a "best-case" [link][1]

## Example 4 

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>

```java
public static int mystery(int[] arr, int x) { 
    int l = 0, r = arr.length - 1; 
    while(l <= r) {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2; 

        if (arr[m] == x) 
            return m;
        
        if (arr[m] < x)
            l = m + 1;
        else 
            r = m - 1;
    }

    return -1;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = {2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 18, 24, 31}; // 1
    mystery(values, 4);
}

```

> How many lines of code are run in this algorithm? 
> (Things just got complicated...it helps if we know what algorithm this is)

</div>

---

## Example 4

<div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>

```java
public static int mystery(int[] arr, int x) {
    int l = 0, r = arr.length - 1;
    while(l <= r) {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;

        if (arr[m] == x) 
            return m;
        
        if (arr[m] < x)
            l = m + 1;
        else 
            r = m - 1;
    }

    return -1;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] values = {2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 18};
    mystery(values, 4);
}

```

- This is Binary Search which we know keeps cutting the search space in half
- Without counting everything, this is O(log(N)) where log is base 2.

</div>

## Merge Sort and Beyond

Merge sort splits an array in half each time and looks at each element in 
each half every time. 

Again without looking at the algorithm we know this would be O(N*log(N))

> Think back to the first activity how would you explain the complexity of that problem? 

---

## The Clique Problem (kind-of)

This is known as a "hard" problem (or NP-Complete) and the only way to solve it would be to 
use a "Brute Force" approach. 

In Big-O notation this would be O(2^n)

> As far as our class goes we won't really deal with these problems but its good to know they exist.
