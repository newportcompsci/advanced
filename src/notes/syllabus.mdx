# Welcome to Special Topics in Computer Science!

## Course Overview

This is a year long course that is going to set the foundation for any student interested in 
pursuing computer science at a deeper level. We will build on our knowledge of Java from 
AP Computer Science and learn more theoretical concepts that are the foundation to any 
computer scientist's tool belt. Many of the concepts that we will discuss during the first 
semester are topics that commonly come up in the technical interview for software engineering 
positions. Once we have laied the groundwork with theory, second semester we will get to 
learn about the more practical side of building software. We will spend a substantial amount of 
time exploring, building, and learning about the various aspects of making great software. 

## Skills and Prerequisites 

- Successfully passed AP Computer Science or instructor approval.
- Basic algebra and problem-solving skills 
- Basic written communication skills 
- An ability to learn from your mistakes 
- A strong curiosity about computer science 
- PERSISTENCE!  

## Course Materials :computer: 

- **Computer**: Students will be issued a school laptop which is perfectly suitable 
  for everything we will be doing in this class.
- **Notebook/Pen**: I expect all students to write their notes in a physical 
  notebook throughout the lessons. 
- **[Github Account](https://github.com)**: We will be learning to use a Git / Github 
  workflow and we will be storing our projects in Github repositories. 
  - *Note*: There are options for students to use private repositories.

## Workload

This is a Post AP level course that is going to cover quite a bit of ground. 
As a rule of thumb, a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes of coding a day is required to
be successful and ensure that you don’t fall behind. If you feel yourself falling 
behind at any point in the class, please communicate that with me as soon as 
possible so I can work with you to be successful.  

## First Semester 

The first semester is a bit more rigid and covers more traditional data structures such as
ArrayList, LinkedList, BinaryTrees, etc. Your grade for this semester will revolve around being
able to show your understaning of these concepts through programming assignments and two tests. 

### Programming Assignments - 70% 

Homework in this course is going to look a little different than in AP Computer Science. 
In AP CS, we were focused on learning how to code in Java, while in this course we are 
more focused on being able to build and manipulate various data structures. Rather than 
just doing practice-it exercises (which I will still reccomend using) we will be writing 
more "real" code to show your understanding of various data structures and how to use them. 

These assignments will make up 60% of your first semester grade. The content of this course 
is going to move fast so be sure to start early on these assignments. There will be 
deadlines for these assignements and for every day that it is turned in I will deduct 5% 
to a max of 20% after 4 days. After 4 days, assignments will not be accepted unless 
you have made prior arrangements with Mr. Rasmussen. 

### Tests - 30% 

There is going to be two major tests over the course of the first semester that will cover all 
the content covered up to that point. The first will be around the end of the first quarter and 
the second will be at the end of the semester. 

After each test I will offer up to 10% back for completing test corrections during tutorial. 

## Second Semester

Where first semester was more theoretical and traditional computer science, second semester 
is a lot more open ended allowing you to explore any topics pertaining to computer science that 
interest you. Your grade for second semester only revolves around two projects, the first of which
will be more structured and the second much more open ended. More information on the two projects
will be provided when we start working on them, but you may start brainstorming ideas now. 

## Project 1 - 25% 

Project one will last about 4 to 5 weeks and is going to have a topic set by Mr. Rasmussen. 
This project is intended to provide some exposure to some more realistic software engineering 
practices such as: working in groups, exploring other programming languages, research, etc. 
We will spend this time working through a typical software design cycle. 

## Project 2 - 75% 

Project two will span the remainder of the semeseter and will allow you to explore any topic 
related to computer science that interests you and is approved by Mr. Rasmussen. You will need to 
build something and be able to present it to your peers at the end of the school year. Part of the 
approval process is also submitting an outline and projected milestones that seem reasonable for 
your project. 

## Expectations 

Students are expected to behave appropriately always in class. Students must be 
attentive and ready to learn and should actively participate in classroom 
activities. This includes taking notes and asking questions during lecture 
time and working on assigned activities during lab time. Students are also 
expected to be paying attention and not using their computers during lectures 
and classroom discussions; computers must only be used during dedicated lab time 
and then only on assigned material. All assignments must be completed and turned 
in on time, and students must be proactive about speaking to the course staff 
about issues. In addition, all NHS rules and policies must be followed and 
respected always. 

## Cellphones :iphone:

Students are expected to put their phone in the pockets at the front of the room 
during class unless the teacher states otherwise. Phones can be picked up one 
minute before the bell rings at the end of class. Part of the professionalism 
points that students earn comes from students showing me when they come into the 
class each day they are here and ready to learn. Students show me this by telling 
me that they can live without their phone for the time they are in the classroom 
by placing it in the phone pockets. If a student doesn’t have a phone, all I ask 
is that they get their parents to email me or write a quick note indicating such.  

## Other Policies 

- Food is not permitted in the classroom and drinks must be in a closed container 
- All content you create (text, images, etc.) must be school appropriate 
- Questions are ALWAYS welcome and are encouraged. Questioning shows that we 
  are wanting to learn and are making an honest attempt to uncover the truth of 
  a subject.
